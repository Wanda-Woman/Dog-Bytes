Dear Betty:

Well ... I must say I am pretty pleased with myself.  I have spent many many hours creating a functional film strip gallery.  
I have done it with one photo.  However, I want to repeat this process for all the thumbnail photos.

I need to create a for loop ... something like

var all-thumbnails = $('.thumb-size').length
  for(var i=0; i < all-thumbnails; i++) 
  
That is where my extensive knowledge ends.  I would like to know how to do the following:
create the for loop that will go around my coding
create internal variables that will get the next photo 
each photo has a unique class.  The number changes with each photo.  
I think I could create a variable called photo?? where ?? is the number but I would need to add 
this number to the class.  I am certain I am not being very clear.  

Hope you like what I have done so far.  I do hope it's not to convoluted.  Can you help me create this loop
so I can make the whole film strip work?

Regards, Wanda
